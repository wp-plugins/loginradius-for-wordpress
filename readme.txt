Product Overview:
= 1. <a href="http://www.loginradius.com/social-login">Social Login</a> = Social login reduces the barriers users face when attempting to register on your website by allowing them to log in with their existing social accounts, including Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google and <a href="http://support.loginradius.com/hc/en-us/articles/202078178-List-of-ID-providers-that-can-be-integrated-via-LoginRadius-API">30 other networks</a>. This eliminates the need to create yet another username and password.
= 2. <a href="http://www.loginradius.com/social-sharing">Social Sharing</a> = Make your users your brand ambassadors and drive high quality referrals to your website - 82% of users consider buying or trying products and services based on their friends’ recommendations. With social share, you give users the tools to share your content, product details and other information with their own networks.
= 3. <a href="http://www.loginradius.com/user-profile-data">User Profile Data</a> = Our solution allows websites to <a href="http://www.loginradius.com/datapoints">collect more than 200 user data points </a>- such as demographics, name, education, verified email address and many more - in order to better understand users.

= 5. <a href="http://www.loginradius.com/social-analytics">Social Analytics</a> = With social analytics, website owners get access to far more data fields than traditional analytics - such as Google Analytics - because they include individual users' interests, gender, education, relationship status, age and also track their activities across websites.
= 6. <a href="http://www.loginradius.com/single-sign-on">Single sign-on</a> = Single Sign-On creates a single authentication system for multiple web properties allowing users to navigate websites with a single account.
